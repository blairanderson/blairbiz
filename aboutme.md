# About Me
Hello, I'm the face behind **Blair.biz**, where we craft custom software solutions for brands and manufacturers, with a sharp focus on **Amazon FBA, TikTok Shop, and AI Tools**. Our mission is to blend creativity with technology, turning the world into an open warehouse filled with endless possibilities.

## My Journey
My expedition into the realm of e-commerce began at **Washington State University**, where my entrepreneurial spirit was ignited. Not only did I major in entrepreneurship, but I also triumphed in the business-plan competition. Post-graduation, I dove into the family business, learning the ropes and understanding the market dynamics.

However, my curiosity led me on a sabbatical, immersing myself in a coding bootcamp. This phase was a game-changer, equipping me with the tools to innovate in the e-commerce landscape. Subsequently, I took the reins of my dad's agency, morphing it into a 100% e-commerce-centric entity.

## Professional Milestones
- **Anderson & Associates - Amazon Manufacturers Representatives**: As the Owner and President since 2017, I've been instrumental in aiding Amazon vendors transition seamlessly to SellerCentral, ensuring smooth operations across all fronts.
  
- **ShareGrid**: As an Engineering Director for eight months, I spearheaded the creation of a real-time Fraud-Detection engine and a core product catalog, paving the way for broader business horizons.

- **Instacart**: My tenure as a Senior Software Engineer saw me revamping the core web interface, enhancing user experience, and promoting platform-agnostic solutions.

- **Quick Left**: As a Full Stack Engineer, I was at the forefront of developing user-centric web and mobile applications, with a keen eye on creating stellar user interfaces and APIs.
